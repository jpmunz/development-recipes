Development Recipes
===================

These recipes are a way for me to record the best practices I've come across for various project types and common
software development tasks. Whenever I encounter similar problems I refer to this documentation to get the bootstrapping
out of the way and focus on the core work involved.

Methodology
-----------

In these recipes I tend favor opinionated tools and frameworks which help to get a new project going by
bypassing `bike-shedding <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding>`_ opportunities.

.. note::

   Although this is an effort to curate best practices often times there's no single `right` way to do something.
   At the end of the day these approaches are simply my own (sometimes arbitrarily chosen) opinions on how to do things
   and your mileage may vary. If you disagree with choices I've made I encourage you to open an issue against the
   project on GitHub or fork these docs and generate your own recipes!
